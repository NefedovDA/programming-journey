# 0. Hello World!

Oh, it's simple classic task!

Hmm, it will be too simple.
Let's make it more interesting!

I should support next console interface:
```text
hello_world [...args]

without arguments, print "Hello, World!"

-n <name> - print "Hello, <name>!"
-i        - ask <name> and print "Hello, <name>!"
```
